    event bubling
    =============
    Event bubbling is a concept in JavaScript where when an event occurs on a DOM element, it first triggers
    the event on that specific element, then it bubbles up through its ancestors in the DOM tree until it 
    reaches the root of the document. This means that if an event handler is attached to multiple elements nested within each other, 
    the event will trigger on each of those elements in sequence, from the innermost element to the outermost.

    In this example, when you click the button, you'll see three log messages in the console:

"Button clicked"
"Inner div clicked"
"Outer div clicked"
Even though you only directly clicked the button, all three event handlers were triggered due to event bubbling.
    The event first triggered on the button, then bubbled up to its parent div (#inner), and finally to the outer div '
    (#outer). Each element's click event handler was executed in sequence according to the bubbling order.
