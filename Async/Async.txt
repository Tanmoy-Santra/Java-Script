javaScript -> is a synchonous language , single threaded
Synchronous = happens at the same time. Asynchronous = doesn't happen at the same time.

Here is a simple explanation of asynchronous and synchronous in JavaScript:
-------------------------------------------------
1.Synchronous code means that the code is executed in order, one line at a time. The next line of code will not be executed until the previous line has finished executing.

2.Asynchronous code means that the code is not executed in order. The next line of code can be executed before the previous line has finished executing


execution context
-----------------
execute one line of code at a time


blocking and non-bloking code
-----------------------------
blocking code : block the flow of program . read fil synchonous

non-blocking code : does not block execution . read file asynchronous
