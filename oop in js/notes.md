## OOP


# javascript and classes
~ Yes, classes do exist in JavaScript. They were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) as syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.

JavaScript classes provide a more familiar and clearer syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance, making it easier for developers coming from other object-oriented programming languages like Java or Python to work with JavaScript.

## objects

~ collection of properties an methods
~ toLowercase , promises , Date

## parts of OOP
~ object literal

~ constructor function
~ prototypes
~ classes
~ instences (new,this)

# 4 pillars

~ Abstraction

  Abstraction involves hiding the complexity of an object and showing only the essential features to the outside world. In JavaScript, you can achieve abstraction by exposing only the necessary methods and properties of an object, while hiding the internal implementation details.

~ Encapsulation
 
  Encapsulation involves bundling the data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components. In JavaScript, you can achieve encapsulation using closures and access modifiers.


~ Inheritence
  
  Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. JavaScript supports prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.

~ Polymorphism

  Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility in method implementation. In JavaScript, you can achieve polymorphism through method overriding.
